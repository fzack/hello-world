# hello-world
Hi - I am Faith Zack, a Software Engineer, and this is my repository for playing with new technologies. My background was originally in C programming, but I continue to bootstrap my way up to keep up with the ever-changing landscape of technologies. I have used Git before in my professional life, but needed to set up this personal playground to track various projects I am doing at UCSC Extension, as well as private exploration. 

You are welcome to read and use anything you find here, but please do drop me a line to introduce yourself and let me know what you are up to. fizfazzle@gmail.com
